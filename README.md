## Track & Tact: A Responsive Robot Car

### Project Description
This project is a robot car built using a Raspberry Pi 4, a motor HAT, and various sensors (e.g., ultrasonic and line sensors). It is programmed to navigate autonomously using sensor inputs to avoid obstacles and follow lines. The documentation has pictures as well as the respective hardware components.

### Features
- Motor Control: Uses Raspberry Pi GPIO to control four motors.
- Autonomous Navigation: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection.
- Line Following: Implements line sensors to follow a designated path.
- I2C Communication: Enabled for motor HAT and sensors.

### Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Waveshare Motor Driver HAT
- DC Motor
- IR Sensor
- Echo Sensor
- Breadboard
- Power Bank
- GPIO Extension Board

### Software Components
- Programming Language: C 
- OS: Raspberry Pi OS
- Dependencies: pigpio (for GPIO manipulation)

### Key Takeaways
- Writing C code to interact with hardware interface
- Controlling motors and sensors using GPIO pins and the pigpio library
- Enabling I2C communication between the motor HAT and sensors
- Processing incoming data in real-time to navigat dynamically
- Troubleshooting issues such as wiring, hardware failure, and code bugs
- Leading and collaborating with a team to integrate hardware and software components.
