## Robot Car - Follow Line and Avoid Obstacles

### Project Description

This robot car is designed to autonomously follow a black line on the ground and avoid obstacles. The system uses a line sensor to detect the line and adjust the motor speeds accordingly to stay on track. The ultrasonic sensor helps the car detect obstacles ahead and adjust its path to avoid collisions.
